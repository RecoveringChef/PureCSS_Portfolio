                <p>I am a fullstack web developer from Orlando, FL. I am not related to the congressman from TX in any
                    way
                    (that I know of).</p>
                <p> I am a career changer who recently left the hospitality management field (more on that below) to
                    attend
                    the coding bootcamp program at the University of Central Florida. I completed the full-time
                    in-person
                    immersive camp and am currently seeking my first role in the industry.

                <h2 class="question">Why leave being a chef</h2>
                <p>Everyone thinks being a Chef sounds so cool; and in a lot of ways it was. However, the restaurant
                    business is horrible way to earn a living. Things like 14 hour days on your feet, 4 hours of sleep
                    between shifts, getting yelled at by guests, horrendous work-life balance (I was basically a
                    part-time
                    dad who was only home when everyone else was asleep for 5 or 6 days of the week), the stress levels,
                    and
                    the physical tolls on your body all add up. Chefs are all, by necessity, workaholic masochists
                    driven
                    only by the passion for our craft and those times getting to do cool stuff offsets the day to day
                    drudgery. For making things, learning new things, and sharing our craft and bringing joy. Once upon
                    a
                    time when I would meet ex-chefs I would think there was no such thing. You either were or you
                    weren’t.
                </p>
                <p>However, it all takes its toll, especially in your family life. Sometimes the fire just doesn’t burn
                    that
                    bright anymore and you start to think about what else you would rather do instead of going in for
                    one
                    more day of the grind. But really the straw that broke the camel’s back was the food allergies. I
                    was
                    making potentially life and death decisions 20+ times per day advising guests what they could or
                    couldn’t have and regularly hand making special dishes to each special need. If you do anything
                    often
                    enough it is inevitable that mistakes will happen. After a 6+ year perfect record of no accidents I
                    messed up 2 in a period of 6 months. Thank god no one was hurt either time, but we usually didn’t
                    know
                    each time we went through the process which ones were “I can just take a benadryl and will be fine”
                    vs
                    “I’m going to inject myself with the epi-pen now. Please call an ambulance”. Reading stories of
                    people
                    dying of food allergies just made me pray it wouldn’t be me that made a mistake that went that way.

                        <p>Why wouldn’t a creatively inclined life-long techie driven to build things with an analytical
                            mind want
                            to build web apps?! If you’re reading this you probably either are one yourself or work for
                            a company
                            full of them.</p>
                        <p>I always joked with coworkers that “If I was smart, I’d work with computers and have a lot
                            less stress
                            and better lifestyle” during those times when we were in our 15th hour of our 7th long shift
                            in a row.
                            In addition to “family tech support” I also worked part time as a freelancer IT support
                            person for
                            Professional Computer Associates building machines, running network cabling and components,
                            installing
                            and configuring Windows, networks, and various industry specific software for clients.</p>
                        <p>Back when I had a small side business teaching and kept a blog I got interested in learning
                            what it
                            actually takes to make a real web page. I knew that using the old Yahoo Sites generator (and
                            later
                            WordPress templates) was not really ‘building a site’ any more than microwaving something in
                            a bag was
                            ‘cooking’. The first time I read an article about someone self-teaching themselves coding
                            and career
                            changing it resonated with me. I always wanted to know how computer code worked. Then when I
                            first read
                            and heard about the bootcamp model I decided that was the way for me to follow my dream.
                            Tales of hard
                            work, high intensity, long hours, and the high-pressure environment of a full-time bootcamp
                            program just
                            sounded like a normal day to me. So, by the time it came to walk away from the stove I
                            already knew
                            where I wanted to pivot my life to.</p>

                        <p> This portfolio site was built using strictly HTML5 and CSS3. As a deliberate design choice,
                            no other
                            languages (JS), libraries, or frameworks were used (bootstrap, etc.). This decision was
                            reached for
                            a
                            few reasons. This site replaces a former portfolio site built on React.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I am a firm believer in the KISS principle and adding libraries and frameworks slows
                                things down
                                unless they are there to serve a specific purpose. Since this is just a static site with
                                no
                                dynamic content or database there was no need beyond saying “I can build React projects”
                                which
                                are
                                already in my GitHub for anyone to look at as well as one of my highlighted projects
                                above.
                            </li>
                            <li>I have been reading up on the ‘Pure CSS’ movement after being inspired by a pair of
                                classmates
                                who introduced me to it, plus talks I attended during the Flashback Conference in
                                Orlando. The
                                idea
                                to do the project like this has expanded my knowledge of what grids and flexbox can do
                                together
                                that make a lot of things routinely tacked onto sites kind of redundant. Along the way I
                                found
                                out I
                                had some misconceptions from my bootcamp time and know now why I was not always getting
                                things
                                to
                                line up properly in those early assignments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I also worked on a JAMstack portfolio using Gatsby, but since taking on this portfolio
                            rebuild
                            project have elected to instead make the Gatsby build be just a pure blog. Coming soon.</p>
