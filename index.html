                        <p>I have been continuing my education as a developer through online courses, webinars,
                            workshops, local dev meetups, and my first developers conference. </p>
                        <p>I have been taking a "buffet" style approach to sampling and learning bits and pieces about a
                            whole array of dev and dev adjacent technologies and tools. Rather than focus on one piece
                            of tech I have been trying to learn 'what I don't know that I don't know' and which areas
                            excite me (almost all of them unfortunately).</p>
                        <p>I have been a part of a group of classmates that continued to meet for weekly coffee (pre
                            lockdown of course) and standups about what we were working on, job search tips and
                            suggestions, helping each other with coding challenges, and book and course reviews. I have
                            also attended group coding sessions with the Code 42 group meeting at Neoware Studios.</p>
                        <p>I have developed an interest in testing and QA through weekend workshops on Cypress with
                            FloSports QA Engineer John Sickels, and JS testing using Jest with Phil Palmieri from
                            Oddball.io.</p>
                        <p>Through local meetups with groups including ODevs, Project Codex, Tech and Beer, Orlando
                            React Developers, Orlando JS devs, and Google Developers Group I have been exposed to many
                            aspects of Web Development not covered in boot camp such as JAMstack, Normal Forms of db
                            structure, SEO basics, edge scripting, managing and monetizing side projects, the role of
                            DevRel, CI/CD pipelines, serverless apps, and progressive web apps among other things. </p>

                        <p> Equal parts The Onion and WebMD were in my head way back in 2013 when I created the first
                            version of Hypochondriac on the Yahoo Sites genrator tool.
                            It began as just a list of funny symptoms and directions to "see disease X". Other than my
                            teaching blog (also a Yahoo site) it was the first thing I made on the web.
                            Version 2.0 was a Wordpress site. Back then I was curious about how to make a 'real' website
                            and always wanted to learn to make it the way it was in my head.</p>
                        <p> This current versin 3.0 was my first solo MERN stack app completed as my demo-day project to
                            finalize my bootcamp experience. I have already learned so much since deploying this version
                            that version 4 is being planned with a different tech stack and some UI tweaks.</p>

                        <p> I've always been a life-long techie and was in love with the internet since being a 90's
                            teen. In 2012 I was doing some teaching as a side job and wanted to do a web page to
                            advertise my classes, host an FAQ, and a blog. I asked around every tech person I knew
                            and most seemed to think it was some kind of voodoo to make scratch custom pages. So I
                            taught myself to use a simple static site generator (yahoo small business) back then. I
                            also made my firsst "just for LOL's" site in 2013 using the same tools (see
                            HympochondriacMD). </p>

                    Why leave being a chef
                </label>

                    <div class="content-inner">
                        <p> This is inarguably the top question I get when meeting new devs. Everyone thinks being a
                            Chef sounds so cool; and in a lot of ways it was. However, the restaurant business is
                            horrible way to earn a living. Things like 14 hour days on your feet, 4 hours of sleep
                            between shifts, horrendous work-life balance (I was basically a part-time dad who was only
                            home when everyone else was asleep for 5 or 6 days of the week), and the physical tolls on
                            your body all add up. Chefs are all, by necessity, workaholic masochists driven only by the
                            passion for our craft and those times getting to do cool stuff offsets the day to day
                            drudgery. For making things, learning new things, and sharing our craft and bringing joy.
                            Once upon a time when I would meet ex-chefs I would think there was no such thing. You
                            either were or you weren’t.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, it all takes its toll, especially in your family life. Sometimes the
                            fire just doesn’t burn that bright anymore and you start to think about what else you would
                            rather do instead of going in for one more day of the grind. But really the straw that broke
                            the camel’s back was the food allergies. I was making potentially life and death decisions
                            20+ times per day advising guests what they could or couldn’t have and regularly hand making
                            special dishes to each special need. If you do anything often enough it is inevitable that
                            mistakes will happen. After a 6+ year perfect record of no accidents I
                            messed up twice in a period of six months. THANK GOD NO ONE WAS HURT EITHER TIME,
                            but we usually didn’t know each time we went through the process which ones were “I can just
                            take a benadryl and will be fine” vs “I’m going to inject myself with the epi-pen now.
                            Please call an ambulance”. Reading stories of people dying of food allergies just made me
                            pray it wouldn’t be me that made a mistake that went that way.

                        <p>Why wouldn’t a creatively inclined life-long techie driven to build things
                            and posessing an analytical mind want to build web apps?! If you’re reading this you
                            probably either
                            are one yourself or work for a company full of them.</p>
                        <p>I always joked with coworkers that “If I was smart, I’d work with computers
                            and have a lot less stress and better lifestyle” during those times when we were in our 15th
                            hour of our 7th long shift in a row. In addition to “family tech support” I also worked part
                            time in IT support for Professional Computer Associates building machines, installing
                            network cabling and components, installing and configuring Windows, and various
                            industry specific software for clients.</p>
                        <p>Back when I had a small side business teaching and kept a blog I got interested in learning
                            what it actually takes to make a real web page. I knew that using a site generator was not
                            really ‘building a site’ any more than microwaving something in a bag was ‘cooking’. The
                            first time I read an article about someone self-teaching themselves coding and career
                            changing it resonated with me. I always wanted to know how computer code worked. Then when I
                            first read and heard about the bootcamp model I decided that was the way for me to follow my
                            dream. Tales of hard work, high intensity, long hours, and the high-pressure environment of
                            a full-time bootcamp program just sounded like a normal day to me. So, by the time it became
                            time to walk away from the stove I already knew where I wanted to pivot my life to.</p>

                        <p> This portfolio site was built using strictly HTML5 and CSS3. As a deliberate
                            design choice, no other languages (JS), libraries, or frameworks were used (bootstrap,
                            etc.). This decision was reached for a few reasons. This site replaces a former portfolio
                            site built on React.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I am a firm believer in the KISS principle and adding libraries and frameworks slows
                                things down unless they are there to serve a specific purpose. Since this is just a
                                static site with no dynamic content or database there was no need beyond saying “I can
                                build React projects” which are already in my GitHub for anyone to look at as well as
                                one of my highlighted projects above. I have also elected to hand code everything using
                                no templates or generators just for the reinforcement.
                            </li>
                            <li>I have been reading up on the ‘Pure CSS’ movement after being inspired by some
                                classmates who introduced me to it, plus talks I attended during the Flashback
                                Conference in Orlando. The idea to do the project like this has expanded my knowledge of
                                what grids and flexbox can do together that make a lot of things routinely tacked onto
                                sites kind of redundant. Along the way I found out I had some misconceptions (i.e.
                                floats, realtive/fixed) from my bootcamp time and know now why I was not
                                always getting things to line up properly in those early assignments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I also worked on a JAMstack portfolio using Gatsby, but since taking on this
                            portfolio rebuild project have elected to instead make the Gatsby build be just a pure blog.
                            Coming soon.</p>
