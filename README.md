# PureCSS_Portfolio
Playing with the "Pure CSS" trend. No Bootstrap or JS with a few fun 'The Office' Easter Eggs just for laughs. Can you spot all Three? Drop me a line if you find all three.

Going all the way back to begining of bootcamp, but using the power of grids and flexbox like I didn't really understand back then to make an appealing and media responsive site without the aid of Bootstrap or any other libraries or frameworks. 

KISS principle in action.
