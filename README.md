# PureCSS_Portfolio
Playing with the "Pure CSS" trend. No Bootstrap or JS with a few fun 'The Office' Easter Eggs just for laughs. Can you spot all Three?

Going all the way back to begining of bootcamp, but using the power of grids and flexbox like I didn't really understand back then to make an appealing and media responsive site without the aid of Bootstrap or any other libraries or frameworks. Also a simple animation that was my first use of pure css animation.

KISS principle in action.
